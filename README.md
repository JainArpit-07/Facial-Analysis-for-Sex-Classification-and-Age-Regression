# Deep Learning-Based Facial Analysis for Sex Classification and Age Regression

## Overview
This project leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to develop an accurate and efficient system for automatic sex classification and age prediction from facial images. The goal is to advance the state-of-the-art in facial analysis and provide practical solutions for various applications in healthcare, biometrics, and marketing.

## Features
- Sex Classification: Determines the gender of individuals based on their facial features.
- Age Regression: Estimates the age of individuals from facial images.
- Robust Analysis: Utilizes deep learning to capture complex and subtle variations in facial appearance.

## Applications
- Healthcare: Accurate age estimation aids in patient profiling and personalized treatment planning.
- Biometrics and Security: Enhances the accuracy and reliability of facial recognition systems.
- Marketing and Consumer Research: Informs targeted advertising strategies and market segmentation through demographic analysis.
